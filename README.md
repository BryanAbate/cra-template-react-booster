# React Booster
## Propulse your React application with a minimal template.

A minimal template to propulse your React application with a state of the art tech stack:
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

This template is providing a minimal boilerplate codebase, it forces no specific pattern and includes no long and complicated config files. This comes with some benefits:
* Easily maintanable
* Easily extandable
* Suits most needs

The goal of this template is to avoid the configuration part that comes with each React project.
